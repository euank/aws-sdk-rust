# aws-sdk-rust

***You don't want this, you want [Rosoto](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto); it works and is named better!***

This is a sorta WIP rust sdk. I worked on it briefly quite a while ago. I got it to the point where I could make a few requests to a few services, but never got the code generation going and everything was hacky. Rosoto is much better! Use it!

If I ever come back to this and it ends up in a more usable happy state, I'll certainly update this :)
